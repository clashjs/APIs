# API Layers

- [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) — Placeholder __text__ outputted in JSON format, covering many common use-cases. Very easy to get started with, perfect to populate a mockup web appplication such as the one we will be making.
- [Unsplash It](https://unsplash.it/) — Placeholder content is not complete without __images__ and this is the definitive place to get them. The documentation is really clear and easy-to-follow, so you can get started in no-time.
- [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) — Another high-quality resource, providing you with generated __user profiles__ that can be custom-tailored to your needs. It allows for a plethora of options, but we will only need a select few in the course of this post.

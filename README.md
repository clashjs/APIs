# API Layers

* [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) — Placeholder **text** outputted in JSON format, covering many common use-cases. Very easy to get started with, perfect to populate a mockup web appplication such as the one we will be making.
* [Unsplash It](https://picsum.photos/) — Placeholder content is not complete without **images** and this is the definitive place to get them. The documentation is really clear and easy-to-follow, so you can get started in no-time.
* [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) — Another high-quality resource, providing you with generated **user profiles** that can be custom-tailored to your needs. It allows for a plethora of options, but we will only need a select few in the course of this post.
